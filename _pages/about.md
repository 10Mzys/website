I am now a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zheng (Tracy) Ke](https://zke.fas.harvard.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at UC Davis, where I was fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Krishna Balasubramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/) and [Prof. Wolfgang Polonik](https://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~polonik/). Before coming to UC Davis, I received my Bachelor's degree in Math at Fudan University, where I was advised by [Prof. Lei Shi](https://mastone1983.github.io/).

My current research lies at the intersection of three domains: Statistics/Applied Probability, Computer Science, and applications in Economics, Biostatistics, and Casual inference. To be precise, I am interested in the following problems:

* Statistical foundations for learning theories: Focus on generalization, transferability, and interpretability of deep learning and machine learning via principled statistical frameworks.
* Uncertainty quantification in Biostatistics, Market Analysis, and Causal Inference related problems.

I have been trained in normal approximation of geometric and topological statistics, nonparametric statistical learning and network analysis as Ph.D. and Postdoctoral fellow.

Recent News
======
* I will give a talk titled `On the nonasymptotic statistical inferences via stabilization theory of Gaussian approximation bounds' at the [22nd INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference](https://informs-aps.isye.gatech.edu/program) at Georgia Institute of Technology from June 30th to July 3rd, 2025.
* Our recent work [Gaussian and Bootstrap Approximation for Matching-based Average Treatment Effect Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17181) is now avaible on Arxiv! Taking ATE as an example, we provide a general framework for non-asymptotic statistical inference via a local geometric concept called `stabilization'.
* I joined the Department of Statistics, Harvard University, on September 1, 2024, as a Postdoctoral Fellow.
