I am now a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zheng (Tracy) Ke](https://zke.fas.harvard.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at UC Davis, where I was fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Krishna Balasubramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/) and [Prof. Wolfgang Polonik](https://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~polonik/). Before coming to UC Davis, I received my Bachelor's degree in Math at Fudan University, where I was advised by [Prof. Lei Shi](https://mastone1983.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in statistical problems arising in machine learning, deep learning and other applications. I am working on topics including:

* Geometric and topological statistics including graph-based statistics and topological data analysis (TDA).
* Network analysis
* Statistical learning including nonparametric statistics, kernel method and deep learning theories.

Recent News
======
* Our recent work [Gaussian and Bootstrap Approximation for Matching-based Average Treatment Effect Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17181) is now avaible on Arvix! Taking ATE as an example, we provide a general framework for non-asymptotic statistical inference via a local geometric concept called `stabililization'.
* I joined the Department of Statistics, Harvard, on September 1, 2024, as a Postdoctoral Fellow.
