I am now a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zheng (Tracy) Ke](https://zke.fas.harvard.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at UC Davis, where I was fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Krishna Balasubramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/) and [Prof. Wolfgang Polonik](https://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~polonik/). Before coming to UC Davis, I received my Bachelor's degree in Math at Fudan University, where I was advised by [Prof. Lei Shi](https://mastone1983.github.io/).

My current research lies at the intersection of three domains: statistical inference, machine learning, and applied probability. To be precise, I focus on understanding the theoretical principles of:
* Statistical learning and dynamic network analysis
* Deep learning and foundation models (including Transformers, dense associative memory/Hopfield networks and reinforcement learning)
* Statistical inference on uncertainty quantification, with applications to machine learning, casual inference and econometrics
For probability, I am interested in Stein's method and its application to normal approximation (Berry-Esseen bounds) under complex non-independence assumptions.

* I am invited to give a talk on `Smooth Dynamic Network Analysis' at the [JSM2025](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2025/), Aug 2025. 
* I will give a talk titled `On the nonasymptotic statistical inferences via stabilization theory of Gaussian approximation bounds' at the [22nd INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference](https://informs-aps.isye.gatech.edu/program) at Georgia Institute of Technology from June 30th to July 3rd, 2025.
* Our recent work [Gaussian and Bootstrap Approximation for Matching-based Average Treatment Effect Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17181) is now avaible on Arxiv! Taking ATE as an example, we provide a general framework for non-asymptotic statistical inference via a local geometric concept called `stabilization'.
* I joined the Department of Statistics, Harvard University, on September 1, 2024, as a Postdoctoral Fellow.
